What are the assumptions here?

Data is downloaded from Doogle and Foursquare and it comprises of combining list two lists, 
one consisting of postcodes, districts, parish,, latitudes, longitudes and the other where we are
extracting only train startions in the area, so theese tow lists have to be merged in order to have one dataframe created.
We have to assume that this list is limited and may not represent the actual state of the affairs and also doesn't represent
the actual availability of a property that is in the optimal distance to the train station. 
But we could just focus on the area/postode within the District.
My focus  will be Bromley in outer London as my free account on  FourSquare api is limited 
so  exploring whole of the London town might get execcssive.
