Problem Description

How to establish the best poscodes within a certain district (Bromley, Bromley town ward) in outer London that has
optimal distance to train stations. 

Who could be interested to learn about this?

People who are looking to find apartments or houses in broader London area that have the best connections 
in terms of access to the trains/transport.

Why should this be relevant for the target group?

Finding an apartment or house in downtown area London is quite expensive and challenging -so taking 
in consideration that one may have very specific needs (related to transportation) in their immediate surrounding. 

So, this little project should should help interested parties to down select easier areas/wards where they would search. 
This solution can be extended to any neighbourhood in London or even any other city
