Problem Description

How to establish the best London subway startions with the highest density of amenities around the given stations
in the inner London area The goal is to understand where is has the highest number of eateries and other amenitiesrequired
to satisfy all the necessities of life in a densely populated area such as London both for residents and tourists alike.

At the same time we are focusing on underdeveloped areas ( as seen as clusters) where there is a troom for further Business |development linked to 
the overall economy of London and the poterntial to push revenues coming from Tourism or commuting workforce even more.

Who could be interested to learn about this?

This is targeting both residnets and tourists who are looking for teh quick access to the ammenities in inner 
London areas that have the highest level of amenities around train stations and at the same time those areaas with the lowest
density or poor access to them, so that could be of interest to Business Developers.

Why should this be relevant for the target group?

Finding a variety of amenities (eateries, convenience stores working 24/7, shops of all sorts) 
can be a frustartining, so the key is a quick access around the trasnport grid that is vital both
for the busy workforce and studnets, but also tourists who also are not familiar with the neighborhood they 
are in at the moment, and they very often rely on the subway or trains because not feeling to be in charge of the unknown space.

So, this little project should should help interested parties who are loking for places aroudn the tarnsportataion w
here there are stilll opprtunities for Business development, and on the other side for the people who are 
looking for the aformentioned quick access to teh city and all it has to offer.

This solution can be extended to any neighbourhood in any other big city.
